- 👋 Hi, I’m @BehnazShojaei. I have a background as a biomedical field service engineer and lecturer.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, big data, signal processing, data-intensive environments, DIY projects, painting, and brewing the perfect pot of tea.
- 🌱 I’m building my skills in data processing and web development with Python, Django, REST APIs, and JS/React, aiming to grow as a software developer.
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on data pipelines, distributed data processing, API design, and scientific computing projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I won a silver medal at a state chess competition when I was 12! I studied French for 2 years, and I can bake birthday cakes like a pro! I enjoy reading kids' books and non-fiction on philosophy, self-development, and finance.
