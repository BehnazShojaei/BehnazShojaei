- 👋 Hi, I’m @BehnazShojaei. I used to work as biomedical field service engineer and a lecturer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, teaching, DIY projects, painting, and a perfect pot of brewed tea.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web design, function development, and test automation.
- 📫 You can reach me at behnaz.shojaei88@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I won a silver medal at a state chess competition when I was 12 years old! I studied French for 2 years! I can bake birthday cakes like an aspiring pro! Nowadays, I only read kids' books and non-fiction on philosophy, self-development, parenting, and finance!
